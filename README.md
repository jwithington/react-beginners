# What's the deal here?

Wes Bos made a [killer React for Beginners][react] course.  As I started working through it, I realized that combining it with my Git skills could mean that I could have a running log of *what I was doing while working on the course*.

This can help me in the future, but also can help anyone wanting to see the process I went through, instead of just "oh hey, he followed a tutorial". In addition, I thought it might be useful for Wes.

I'm keeping a running document of classnotes over in [class-notes.md][notes] and I feel like being able to see their changes in each step might also be useful.

Finally, I definitely would not have posted all this if the files weren't [already available on Github][files].

Enjoy!
