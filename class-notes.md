# Everything in React is a component
  - an app piece I can use over and over
  - chunk it out into sections we can shell out to a component
  - a fish is a fish -> can just make work on that one little component
  - reusable chunks of code

# JSX makes this work

```
render : function(){
  return (
    <p>hellooooooooooo</p>
  )
}
```

# React props are like attribute tags in html
- example <Header tagline="Fresh Seafood Market"/>
- you can make anything like this up

# Some html/css stuff
- always have to have an enclosing element or Gulp will yell at you
- have to use className instead of class because of JSX
