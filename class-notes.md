# Everything in React is a component
  - an app piece I can use over and over
  - chunk it out into sections we can shell out to a component
  - a fish is a fish -> can just make work on that one little component
  - reusable chunks of code

# JSX makes this work

```
render : function(){
  return (
    <p>hellooooooooooo</p>
  )
}
```
